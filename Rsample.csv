Since we're not going to completely deregulate the banking sector; the societal will is not there, then the other option is to regulate BTC similarly.

If you have issues, work toward reforming FINRA.

If Bitcoin is not regulated, then society will grow to realize that it does not comply with society's standard's, and then it risks eradication and outright criminalization. I would not be surprised if many people are arrested under FINRA one day, regardless of warning or guidance from the SEC.

Is that what you want?

You speak of innovation, but I don't really think of Bitcoin as particularly innovative. Its just a method of circumventing regulation, but circumventing regulation is illegal and societally immoral. Circumventing regulation in any way other than modification of regulation through the democratic process is wrong.


As to your last topic about laws. Society need not prove laws work or not. Laws are created by society, and whatever society agrees upon is morally correct, no matter how arbitrary or capricious. You are of course welcome to leave society, but you will be sent out on your back, and also be forced to repay society for the education you have received and the head start in technology that education creates.

&gt; Ex-German Bank chief economist warns of paper money and socialism lead to ruin - now threaten the bondage?
&gt; Author: editorial w: o
&gt; 10.14.2014, 09:49 | 11272 views | 8 | druckversion
&gt; 
&gt; A new book could provide explosive. Posted it has Thomas Mayer, ex-chief economist at Deutsche Bank. In this he is not only the banks to blame for the financial crisis, on top of that he calls for an end of the paper money. A radical new financial order would her, otherwise threatened the destruction of our prosperity.
&gt; 
&gt; We live in a time when a financial crisis the next hunt. Central banks print more and more money, inflation rises. But through the many notes form price bubbles - bubbles that burst at some point. The result: a serious crisis. The supposed solution: more cheap money. And voil¨¤, the vicious cycle begins again.
&gt; 
&gt; In his new book ""The New Rules of Money - Why we need monetary reform"" the Ex-top banker Thomas Mayer deals with exactly this devilish spiral and crisis calls for a radical new beginning.
&gt; 
&gt; Paper money and socialism lead to ruin
&gt; 
&gt; In his opinion, our current paper money system is to blame for the misery. Or rather, it is the central banks and banks that make more and more money out of nothing and so the stem a crisis so that they create another. This leads over time to a society's need for stability, so Mayer in an interview with "" Business Week "". States would serve this need then by intervened in the economy and capitalism gradually transferred into a socialist economic system in this way.
&gt; 
&gt; And so we would, according to Mayer exactly at that point, or that ""ism"", the liberal economist has always been the fear teaches socialism. Mayer also can be the mantra ¨¤ la Friedrich von Hayek not escape and speaks of socialism that destroyed the prosperity and inevitably leads to slavery. And because the paper money in turn is just the beginning, socialism at the end of this fatal chain of causation is for Mayer clearly: ""Because socialism leads to destruction, is the credit system that promoted socialism, dangerous."" It is high time rumzurei?en the helm and to preserve us from destruction. Mayer has also directly ready for a proposed solution: A new monetary system must be found.
&gt; 
&gt; Active money is credit money to replace
&gt; 
&gt; Mayer argues in favor of replacing the current credit money through ""active money"". Active money? ""Money does not materialize, in contrast to loan money through a debt ratio, but is based on an asset, says former chief economist at Deutsche Bank. The point of this money system: The money can not be increased. Banks and States is that everyone access to the creation of new money withdrawn as "" Der Spiegel notes "". Instead, the central bank in Mayers active monetary system the money directly to the citizens. Money that they do not any prints, but produces ""public confidence in the money"" by. How this would work exactly, it goes Mayer in the interview with the ""Business Week"" is not a closer. However, it is essential that people between different currencies could choose. This competition of currencies would put any issuer, such as the ECB limits and thus ensure that not too much money is spent. The radical liberalism of the ""Austrian School of Economics"" Greetings.
&gt; 
&gt; For the banks, it gets back to basics
&gt; 
&gt; And the banks? The recall in this scenario back on their core tasks, namely the securing of deposits and mediating between savers and investors. Where: A business credit can only come about if all loans are fully cover through savings. For loans from which to draw nothing, these times would be pass¨¦.
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin Euro instead?
&gt; 
&gt; So far, so good. But how should this new active money actually look like? According to Mayer, it may well also have a virtual character. Specifically, he cites the example of Bitcoin. Raises the digital currency so soon from the Euro? Not necessarily. According to Mayer of the euro need not necessarily disappear, especially since the active monetary system offering especially for the euro zone, because it was working completely without a state. Mayer's judgment: ""Should the euro survive, he must be repositioned as active money. As a passive money he is doomed to failure. ""
&gt; 
&gt; If you believe his statements, it is not just the euro, but we are all doomed. Namely, if we do not use the financial crisis as a ""chance of the century"", ""to replace our dysfunctional monetary system by a better one."" Otherwise, we will stagger from the financial crisis in the money crisis and destroy the foundations of our prosperity, warns Mayer. "

Bitcoin just isn't the sort of investment you think it is. The key point of it all is, you can actually do something to contribute, which will make Bitcoin better, all of which is supposed to be incentivized by your investment in it. This is another reason why, interestingly, Bitcoin will continue to preserve a core anarchistic audience, because they are less likely to be affected by game theoretic dilemmas and ""divest"".

Now, what will happen is, this sort of euphoric investors will leave, price will suffer, those who are interested in building up this system will remain and continue building it until people realize again that it's not going away and euphorically invest again. That how it's been happening for the last 4 years I've been actively observing.

Usually I just ignore the BS and focus on the important. Recently, that was impossible due to nearly every thread at the top dedicated to freakouts over a large pool getting close to 51%. But this is not new. It's happened before and it will happen again. The important thing to know is that 51% does not equal a 51% attack. 




This whole thing is classic FUD (in a literal sense, as opposed to intentional FUD *pushing*). We talk about bubble cycles a lot in here, and this freakout is what I call the noob cycle. New bitcoiners who never really thought about it before are alarmed when they realize that *the success of bitcoin as a global economical disruptor is not a sure thing*. If it were, the price would already be $1M per, or whatever the value at peak adoption will be.



[This post highlights](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/27mjzu/wed_like_to_pay_forward_1_of_our_bitcoin_business/) the severity of the ridiculousness. In this case, an unwitting but well-intentioned individual is offering to donate 1% of their bitcoin profits to a CENTRALIZED entity that theoretically will help against the highjacking of the network by a bad actor. The problem is, one can never truly know the intent of an individual, let alone an organization comprised of many individuals, and which may be subject to coercion by another group or government... which is one of the primary reasons bitcoin was created in the first place--to be trust**less**.

This person wants to give money to a centralized defender of the network but *if* GHASH is a good actor then they are already the single greatest guardian against bad actors. With 40%, the chance of anyone else getting a majority is nearly nonexistent. The caveat to that is, if a large government were to spend a measly billion dollars to destroy the network, nothing would stop that. And so we should not freak out about something that we cannot control. The best we can do is be informed about all known failure points and apply that knowledge when assessing the risk of bitcoin as a speculative instrument. If that unknown is too much for you, then simply get out of bitcoin.

You should realize that the reason we use(d) both silver and gold as money is because gold has too high a value density to be used for small transactions. You can't buy your lunch with gold because it's not practical to measure out a small enough amount of gold accurately enough to pay such a small sum.

You raise a good point about being able to track address traffic, but unless a beginner is planning on making high-volume transactions and keeping the majority of their bitcoin in a single address, this 'entry' method will help them manage their bitcoin in a way that they're already familiar with, which is the point of this post.

No, I just had a android phone and *didn't like it*. Stereotyping a company's customers is wrong and doesn't help image. 

One thing to notice would be that *yes* maybe android owners are the type that would like to be 'paid in Bitcoin' for example. (Again a generalisation that's complete rubbish).

How about some evidence to back up your claim that Netflix gets 1%, or near it, beyond conjecture? If you have been to business school (as if an MBA even warrants bragging rights anymore; it's the graduate equivalent of underwater basketweaving unless it comes from a small handful of schools) I hope you learned that numbers and facts win arguments, not semantics akin to ""businesses cut deals because they're businesses and that is what businesses do!""

 I'll agree that whatever they pay, it's probably a very good rate, so maybe even 3.5% is high. (Doesn't really change the validity of my argument, since whether it is 5%, 3.5%, or less, I can guarantee it isn't as low as using Bitcoin as your payment system.)

Also, since all of my examples are US-only, so long as being pedantic is en vogue, unless you have insider information, their most recent earnings call declared just under 30 million US subscribers. 

And finally, also forcing me to question what, if anything, you learned at business school, you seem to believe that Netflix would get a large discount purely based on the fact that they lose nothing in the event of fraud:

First, I agree that they lose nothing, but I expect the RIAA and MPAA might argue this point. I'm not sure what Netflix thinks about piracy, as far as whether they lost anything. I guess since they stream, and it isn't p2p, they are out some fraction of a cent or perhaps a couple cents for the bandwidth through their peering agreements with CDNs etc. In any case they are out more than Disney is when something is watched via torrent without payment. 

Second, and this is really the crux of your cluelessness, credit card companies almost *always* revert the payment and leave the cost to the merchant. Even when it is something physical; reimbursement of merchants for the chargeback almost *never* happens. Visa et al refunds the customer, pulls the funds back from the merchant, and that is it. So, that is good for Netflix and Bitcoin, as it makes Bitcoin's lack of chargebacks a negligible risk for their business model; but it seems to have *jack fucking shit* to do (arguments are more valid if we add *fucking*) with whether a card company would offer a discount. 

So, what is your point exactly? And why are you replying to multiple comments by me in this comment tree with the exact same thing?"

First of all, yes, without a doubt, bitcoin is a currency right now. The bar is actually rather low for something qualifying as a currency. In prison, cigarettes are a currency.

No analogy is perfect. You can convert bitcoins into normal cash if the timing is right, just ***like*** a lottery ticket. Not ***exactly the same as*** a lottery ticket. A lottery ticket is a worthless piece of paper, until it suddenly isn't.

Look; I've used bitcoin. I think the idea is great, if actually used as a currency. I think it's a truly ***ludicrous*** method of investment. Economies run on currency being spent, not hoarded. If it's hoarded, it's just tulips all over again. People that invest in them ***need*** other people to buy in to increase their value. It's a pump-and-dump.

107,2014/6/25 16:10,2014/6/25,theenecros,litecoin,1403712609,0,0,"What I've seen happen with Bitcoin may happen with Litecoin. The main issue with ASICs are institutional miners. They buy up a huge amount of hashing power, build a facility to house their miners, suck up a huge amount of electricity and then cash out virtual currency to pay the bills and make a profit. The only problem with this is it drives the price down as they are not holding. That said, at some point it becomes not worth it to cash it out and they may decide to hold, until the price gets high enough for them to cash out again. Unfortunately this means there is a ceiling on the price and the currency never really gets a chance to grow like it did historically. Also ASICs can centralize a large part of the coins hashing power making a 51% attack easier and more likely. The good parts about ASIC is it adds maturity to the network...it's an evolution that any good coin will go through, even coins with complex code like Darkcoin will eventually have ASIC technology but that will take several years."
108,2014/1/23 5:02,2014/1/23,krispyk84,litecoin,1390453352,0,0,"If I understand correctly, your point is that a major exchange adds litecoin, and reaps the rewards of added trading volume, thus higher fee rakes off of those transactions. 

Since exchanges are competitive with one another, those exchanges that have yet to adopt LTC look on, and feel a sort of business envy in the sense that other exchanges are profiting from LTC trading volume and they are not, so they rush to implement it so that they can get a piece of the pie.

The only major player (if they can still be considered major) that has expressed interest in LTC has been Mt.Gox. I failed to come up with any evidence through google searches that Bitstamp, and Coinbase have any plans to implement LTC anytime soon. Bitpay has come out and flat out rejected LTC. 

The reality that I am seeing is that Gox is becoming a smaller and smaller player by the day. Their trade volume suffers, the lack of liquidity has crippled its business and caused them to no longer be considered the defacto market for Bitcoin. If they do implement LTC, it won't solve their liquidity problem. If Gox implements LTC, will other exchanges look on with the business envy required to get them to take action? Is Gox still considered a competitive enough threat to even drive the other exchanges to take action?

BTC-E is enjoying a ton of the volume trades in LTC, and has a huge chunk of the overall crypto volume pie. Their volume share is larger than Mt.Gox. You would think that their lack of transparency would present an opportunity for other exchanges to jump in. It'd be easy to take over a very large chunk of the existing LTC trading volume from BTC-E as simply marketing themselves as an exchange they can trust. But even this dangling carrot isn't enough to entice Bitstamp, Coinbase, et al. to adopt LTC.

I'm just curious to see why you may think that Gox would be enough to trigger the business envy required to get everyone else to jump on board when BTC-E has not."

In theory. In practice other coins can come in and saturate the market. Bitcoin isn't unique or uncopiable. Also, the number of coins is technically unlimited because of the divisibility thingy, but instead of bitcoin going to the gazillions, other coins will help to distribute the economic activity. If government doesn't ban it, every major retailer will have their own coins with the same bitcoin features. See my thread about how Amazon could kill bitcoin...

The concept of liquid voting is also interesting but I'm not sure how it would withstand abuse. I think the way to go on voting is a similar protocol to Bitcoin, but it would likely need to be paired with another protocol for registering people. The concept of decentralization using network agreement and cryptography is more compelling and secure in my opinion.

And I never said this will have no effect, I would expect a short term overreaction.

My analysis is based on general adaption and the growth of the economy behind Bitcoin. The outlook based on that is better than it was a year ago (where Gox was almost alone and had the same problems)."

For example people in other comments say they will just use a energy meter on their rigs and could show the ATO their rigs current average reading. Well, over a 1 year time frame I've probably changed my setup 20 times. So it would never be possible to ""prove"" my energy readings during those existing configurations, aside from keeping a spreadsheet of how it changed over time. I will start a spreadsheet to monitor the consumption of my mining rigs over time...

I would assume that mining would not be considered capital gains, but if you are buying and selling coins like any commodity then I'd assume capital gains would be most appropriate. I believe the ATO has addressed trading bitcoins before but not specifically mentioned mining. In any case I assume we could apply for a ruling.

It would be really great to find someone who can do my tax returns who does have some idea what bitcoin is. I loathe the idea of explaining it to someone who's never heard of it."

I bought bitcoin at $11 and sold at $900. I think I am alright at handling money. I make enough so that I will reach the goals of my 5 year plan.

Don't get all judgmental just because I know how to make money on a volatile security. Let me worry about my personal finances.

&gt;Secondly, no employer would pay you a fixed bitcoin amount because the volatility is far too high.

... Maybe you missed the part about being paid in bitcoin. I know it would be stupid of an employer to pay me in bitcoin if they are being paid in usd. If they do that they would be moronic. If they make their profits in bitcoin on the other hand. No problem.
